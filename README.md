# isys-102-hw3
Website for assignment 3 in the WVU Tech ISYS-102 course. Makes use of navbars, rounded corners, clear, float, link buttons, and more.

# How it's made
**Tech Used:** HTML and CSS

I started by getting the website's skeleton made using a header and footer, and some columns. From there I added a horizontal navbar below the header with some styling on it. The navbar has link buttons on it that make use of hover styling. I made link buttons in the navbar go to back.html, which is a webpage that only has a link button on it that redirects users to the home page.

After that, I made a vertical navbar in the left column and added similarstyling to that. Once I had the header and both navbars set up correctly, I worked on the content of the page: the image gallery. I made four image gallery divs and added images to them with descriptions and titles. I made use of "overflow" to make sure the images get clipped if they go outside of the image gallery div. I also added a hover border and rounded corners. I added the functionality of clicking the image to open it in a new tab.

# Lessons Learned:

I learned that CSS is pretty fun to mess around with. I enjoyed slowly building different parts of the web page and seeing it become something I was happy with. I learned how to make better use of selectors in CSS as well as use the new CSS properties learned in class recently. On top of the actual website building stuff, I tried my best to make use of git and learn how to use it properly. I attempted to commit every notable change I made along the way and push when I was done. This is an important skill to learn because git and github are widely used skills in the development world.
